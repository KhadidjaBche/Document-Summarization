The Chilean government has protested Pinochet's arrest, insisting that as a senator he was traveling on a diplomatic passport and had immunity from arrest.
The British and Spanish prime ministers said Sunday that the fate of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet is in the hands of their judicial authorities and they will not interfere.
Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.
